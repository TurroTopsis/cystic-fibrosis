# Suppport

The [**Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF)**](https://www.cff.org/){:target="_blank"} is the most prominent American nonprofit organization dedicated to helping patients with CF and their loved ones by providing 1) care, 2) education, 3) research, 4) support, and 5) outreach.

1. The CFF has over 130 [care centers](https://apps.cff.org/ccd){:target="_blank"} dedicated to treating CF, and has created the [CFTR2 database](https://cftr2.org/) to inform patients of which modulators are best suited to their particular mutation
2. The CFF website provides a myriad of educational [articles](https://www.cff.org/intro-cf){:target="_blank"} about the cellular and genetic nature of CF, the various symptoms, and possible treatments
3. The CFF sponsors research to develop novel CF treatments and search for a potential cure, and maintains a [Patient Registry](https://www.cff.org/medical-professionals/patient-registry){:target="_blank"} to provide researchers valuable information about the health status of CF patients
4. The CFF [connects](https://www.cff.org/support){:target="_blank"} CF patients with legal experts to help families explore their insurance options and other patients to create a supportive community
5. The CFF hosts the [Great Stride](https://fightcf.cff.org/site/SPageServer/?pagename=143_gs_landing_page){:target="_blank"} walkathons through the United States to raise money to support their search for a cure to CF. In a personal interview, Mrs. Rice explained that she participates extensively in the Great Stride walkathons and the CFF’s other outreach programs as it is a mutually beneficial relationship: “They [the CFF] helps us, we help them.”
