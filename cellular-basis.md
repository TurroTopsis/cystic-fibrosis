# Cellular Basis

CF patients have a genetic mutation somewhere in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene so that their cells either produce dysfunctional or not enough CFTR protein.

_The CFTR protein is made of 1,480 amino acids._

The normal purpose of the CFTR protein is to act as an ion channel that moves Cl⁻ from the cytoplasm (inside) of cells to the extracellular matrix (outside). CFTR protein is needed to move Cl<sup>-</sup> to the matrix because the negative charge on Cl<sup>-</sup> attracts water molecules (H2O, which has a negatively charged oxygen), thus hydrating the cell surface. In the lungs, this layer of water on the outside of the cell surface allows cilia (broom-like hairs on the surface of lung cells) to sweep excess mucus out of airways. 

When the CFTR protein is dysfunctional, Cl<sup>-</sup> in the cytoplasm is unable to move to the matrix. With less Cl<sup>-</sup> in the matrix, water is not attracted to the cell surface. In the lungs, without a layer of water on the cell surface, the mucus is so thick and sticky that cilia can’t sweep the mucus away, so the airways become clogged.
