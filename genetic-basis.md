# Genetic Basis

CF is an **autosomal recessive** disorder.
*   The fact that it is _autosomal_ means that the CFTR gene is carried on somatic, non-sex chromosomes, so the disorder is equally common amongst men and women
*   The fact that it is _recessive_ means that an individual must inherit the recessive allele from both parents to have the disorder

The **recessive allele** (denoted by a lowercase c) carries a gene that produces dysfunctional CFTR, whereas the **dominant allele** (denoted by an uppercase C) carries a gene that produces functional CFTR. There are approximately 1,700 known mutations of the CFTR gene that produce a dysfunctional protein, thus causing CF.
- If an individual inherits 2 recessive alleles, they are a CF patient
- If an individual inherits 1 recessive allele, they are a **carrier**
  - _Carriers_ do not express symptoms of CF, but they may pass the recessive allele onto their children
  - Approximately 10,000,000 Americans are CF carriers (1 in 30)
- If an individual inherits 0 recessive alleles, they are unaffected by CF

There are 5 categories of CF-causing mutations:
1. **Protein Production** 
    1. Test
3. **Protein Processing** 
4. **Gating**
5. **Conduction**
6. **Insufficient Protein**
